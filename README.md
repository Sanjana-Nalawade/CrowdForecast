# CrowdForecast

Inspiration
Our inspiration for CrowdForecast came from the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we all know social distancing is much preferred and a key guideline to every individual to avoid any further circumstances. So our major approach from this platform is to aware people of the crowded areas near them earlier.

What it does
So our project is basically a web app that will let the user give an exact amount of people in the specific area. If the area has a limited amount of seats or the vacancies and it is already full by people or if a great amount of crowd is already gathered then it will notify users that avoid going to a certain place. Examples: For example, if we consider restaurants, metro trains/stations, buses, etc. where the CCTV footage is available, by processing that data through our website we can give the exact amount of people in the respective area by considering the available vacancies so that the user is pre-aware about the place.

How we built it
Firstly choosing the topic to work on is a bit easy thing as we are facing a lot of crises during this year. Being a techy people in and out we all were thinking about contributing to the social cause technically, and so we came up with the idea to build a web app that can lead us to make sure about the biggest guideline given by the governments of various countries and that is social distancing. So we first decided to monitor the crowded places through the cctv footage availbale and give the exact number of people in the video frame. By doing this we can actually aware people about the vacancies available at the certain place or not. By doing this we can avoid going to crowded places by knowing it earlier that the place is crowded. For this we have used Google Vision Api and integrated it with the web app that we have created using flask

Challenges we ran into
We mainly faced difficulties relating to the handling of APIâ€™s and their integration with the software since it was our first time working with it.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being new to hackathons, we feel proud that we could come up with this project that could have a great impact on the major problems like the COVID-19. And even though there are many places we have to work upon, but to able to present this within this short period and learning a lot of new things is one of our biggest takeaways!

What we learned
Firstly this entire hackathon was a great learning experience as it helped us improve our coding skills and helped us to experiment with many new things which we were not familiar with earlier. Through our project, we were able to use our technical skills to create a product that promotes social responsibility by giving them pre-knowledge about the harm they can cause to society unknowingly, a social cause that makes this a whole lot special for us. It has also inspired us to implement more of such projects in the future.

What's next for CrowdForecast
There is a lot of scope for improvement in CrowdForecast as it can be built as a full web app and help in maintaining social distancing. It can have a more accurate forecasting and a better GUI.
